Name of Quantlet:   "Compare_different_stopping_rules"



Description:        "Here different stopping rules for (L2-)Boosting method are investigated. 
                     We compared the performance of L2-Boosting algorithm using different stopping criteria like:
                        corrected AIC(BÃ¼hlmann, 2006), gMDL(Hansen and Yu, 2001), CV, and early stopping.
                                        
                     In the simulation setting, we used Gaussian multivariate data for predictor variables with a real-valued outcome variable.
                     The performance of each algorithm is measured by mean MSE.
                     
                     In the practical application, the data for ___ is used."
