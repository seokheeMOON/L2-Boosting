# L2-Boosting
This is to provide some numerical results for the performance of L2-boosting algorithm in high-dimensional linear settings. Moreover, two computationally attractive stopping criteria - the corrected AIC method and the in-sample early stopping rule - are compared in Monte Carlo simulations.
