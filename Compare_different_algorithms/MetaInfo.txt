Name of Quantlet:   "Compare_different_algorithms"



Description:        "This is to compare the performance of L2-Boosting with different linear algorithms in high dimensional linear settings.
                     As comparables, we used OLS, Forward Stagewise Linear Regression (FSLR), LASSO, Ridge regression methods.
                     
                     The performance of each algorithm is measured by mean MSE.
                     
                     In the simulation setting, we used Gaussian multivariate data.
                     In the practical application, the data for ___ is used."
